    <div id="fear">
    <h2>Fear is the path to the dark side.</h2>
    <p class="fearp">As a slave on the desert planet of Tatooine, Anakin lived in constant fear for his own safety and the safety of his mother. He was also haunted by visions of his mother's death, which fueled his fear and anxiety. When he was discovered by the Jedi and taken to Coruscant, his fear was compounded by feelings of inadequacy and a sense of not belonging.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="anger">
    <h2 class="anger">Fear leads to anger.</h2>
    <p class="anger">Later, Anakin now as young adult, was being trained by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin begins to have nightmares of his mother's death, which fueled his fear and anger.</p>
    <p class="anger">These fears and anxieties began to take a toll on Anakin, and his anger and frustration started to manifest in impulsive behavior and reckless actions.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="hate">
    <h2>Anger leads to hate.</h2>
    <p>As Anakin becomes more consumed by his anger, his emotions turn to hatred, particularly towards the Jedi Order and the Jedi Council. This hatred ultimately drives him to betray and attack the Jedi, culminating in the events of Order 66 and the fall of the Republic.</p><p>Anakin's hatred towards the Jedi Order, whom he believes have betrayed him and his loved ones, is a driving force behind his transformation into Darth Vader.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="suffering">
    <h2 class="suffering">Hate leads to suffering.</h2>
    <p class="suffering">As Darth Vader, Anakin's anger and hatred consume him, and he becomes one of the most feared and powerful Sith Lords in the galaxy. His ruthless pursuit of power and control leads him to commit countless acts of violence and destruction, causing suffering and pain to those around him.</p>
    <p class="suffering">Despite his immense power, however, Darth Vader is also a tragic figure, deeply tormented by the consequences of his actions.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="redemption">
    <h2>In suffering, redemption was found</h2>
    <p>In the end, Vader redeemed himself by saving his son Luke Skywalker from Emperor Palpatine, the leader of the Empire, and sacrificing his own life in the process. This act of selflessness and love allowed Vader to find redemption and ultimately be remembered as a hero instead of a villain.</p>
